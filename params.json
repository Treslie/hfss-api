{"name":"Hfss-api","tagline":"A HFSS API to control HFSS from Matlab","body":"# HFSS-MATLAB-SCRIPTING-API\r\n\r\n##Introdution\r\n\r\nHFSS-MATLAB-API is a library toolbox to control Ansoft HFSS from MATLAB using \r\nthe HFSS Scripting Interface. This tool provides a set of MATLAB functions to \r\ncreate 3D objects in HFSS by generating the required HFSS Scripts. Basically, \r\nanything that can be done in HFSS user interface and the 3D Modeler can be \r\ndone with this library of functions. Once a script is generated in this \r\nmanner, it can be run in HFSS to generate the 3D model, solve it and export \r\nthe data. You create your entire design in MATLAB and basically use HFSS to \r\nsolve it.\r\n\r\n##Files\r\nAll the files are organized in the following directories.\r\n\r\n* doc/ - contains the documentation and doxygen-mtocpp related files.\r\n* examples/ - contains example m-files.\r\n* src/general/ - contains files for operations such as File Open/Save/Close, and Project Create/Save/Make Active etc.,\r\n* src/3dmodeler/ - contains m-files that generate VBScripts for the 3D-Modeler.\r\n* src/analysis/ - contains m-files for Analysis (Setup/Solve/Export).\r\n* src/boundary/ - contains m-files for setting up boundaries.\r\n\r\n##Original Author:\r\nVijay Ramasami,\r\nRSL, Univ. of Kansas,\r\nLawrence, KS, 66046.\r\nE-Mail: rvijayc@gmail.com, rvc@ieee.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
